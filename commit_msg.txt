fix: Resolve Auth.js Drizzle adapter compatibility with Proxy object

- Updated lib/auth.ts:
  - Used getDb() to pass the real Drizzle instance to DrizzleAdapter.
  - Auth.js adapter does not support Proxy objects and throws "Unsupported database type".
- Updated lib/db/index.ts:
  - Improved Proxy logic to handle special properties (constructor, symbols).
  - Added documentation for getDb() as the safe way to get the real instance.
- Verified: Local build now passes successfully (Exit code: 0).
