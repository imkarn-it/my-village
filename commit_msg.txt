fix: Mark database-dependent pages as force-dynamic to prevent static prerendering

Added export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic' to 9 pages that import db:
- admin: page, parcels, profile
- resident: page, profile
- security: page, alerts, visitors, profile

This prevents Next.js from attempting to statically generate these pages
during build when DATABASE_URL is not available.
