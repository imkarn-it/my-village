fix: Resolve UUID validation error in registration and improve projectId handling

- Fixed registration failure caused by invalid UUID string 'default-project' in app/api/[[...slugs]]/route.ts.
- Updated registration logic to find the first available project or create a default one with a valid UUID.
- Updated announcements endpoint to handle missing projectId by falling back to the first available project.
- Updated NewFacilityPage and EquipmentPage to use projectId from the user's session via useSession hook.
- Removed all occurrences of hardcoded 'default-project' UUID string.
