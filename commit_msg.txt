fix: Rename Elysia auth routes to avoid conflict with NextAuth

- Renamed Elysia auth endpoints from /api/auth/* to /api/user/* in app/api/[[...slugs]]/route.ts.
- This fixes the "UnknownAction" error caused by conflict with NextAuth's catch-all route at /api/auth/[...nextauth].
- Updated register, forgot-password, reset-password, and verify-email pages to use the new /api/user/* endpoints.
- Switched to using the type-safe Eden Treaty client for these API calls.
- Added debug logs to lib/auth.ts to help diagnose "CredentialsSignin" errors in CI.
