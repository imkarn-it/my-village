fix: Setup GitHub Actions for E2E testing and fix API validation

- Updated .github/workflows/test.yml:
  - Added PostgreSQL service for E2E tests.
  - Added AUTH_SECRET and DATABASE_URL environment variables.
  - Added database setup and e2e:seed steps.
  - Restricted E2E tests to Chromium in CI for faster runs.
- Fixed app/api/[[...slugs]]/route.ts:
  - Updated bill creation validation to accept both string and number for 'amount'.
  - Ensured 'amount' is converted to string before inserting into DB.
- Refactored lib/db/index.ts:
  - Used a Proxy for the db instance to provide clear error messages if accessed without DATABASE_URL.
  - Maintained compatibility with Auth.js by conditionally using the DrizzleAdapter.
