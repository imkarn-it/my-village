fix: Resolve DATABASE_URL build error with lazy db initialization and TypeScript fixes

- Modified lib/db/index.ts to use properly typed lazy proxy for db
- Changed upload and upload-payment-slip routes to use dynamic auth import
- Added explicit TypeScript type annotations to map/reduce callbacks in:
  - admin/page.tsx, admin/parcels/page.tsx
  - resident/page.tsx, security/page.tsx
  - security/alerts/page.tsx, security/visitors/page.tsx
