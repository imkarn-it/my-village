fix: Resolve Auth.js DrizzleAdapter compatibility with build-time db availability check

- Modified lib/db/index.ts to export real drizzle instance (null when DATABASE_URL missing)
- Added isDatabaseAvailable() and getDb() helper functions
- Updated lib/auth.ts to conditionally use DrizzleAdapter only when database is available
- Build now passes without DATABASE_URL in CI environment
